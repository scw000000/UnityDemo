Readme of Lab2:

1. Baseline requirement:
    Scene complexity: This scene contains a maze which always have an entrance and exit.

    Scene motion: This scene can rotate around y axis by pressing 0, and the maze and model will rotate altogether.

    Model complexity: The model is a cube which is constructed by script "AvatarInitiate" in game object ¡§Avatar¡¨.

    Model motion: The motion of the model is constrained by the wall of the maze and ground, also, it can rotate around 
      its own y axis by holding the right mouse button and drag the mouse. Also, you can rotate the camera by holding left mouse button.

2. Additional features:
    This maze is procedurally generated by the script ¡§Maze Builder¡¨, the script is the component of the game object ¡§ground¡¨.
      Every time the play button is pressed, the maze will change. I used the Growing Tree Algorithm to implement the maze generation.

    Moreover, I provided some parameters for the maze generation. You can change it in the script component field of the ground object:
a. Row count and column count: you can specify the dimension of the maze.
b. Wall prefab: you can change the default wall object for something else.
c. Maze scale: you can modify the scale of the brick, so you can actually play this maze.
d. Generate type: this parameter indicates how the growing tree is built, three different types are provided.
